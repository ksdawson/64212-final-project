The chess pieces are sourced from https://free3d.com/3d-model/another-chess-60360.html.
This gives a pawn, king, queen, bishop, knight, and rook for both dark and light in one object.
We want each piece in its own object, so I uploaded the object and mtl files to https://3dviewer.net/.
It will show each individual mesh in the left-hand panel. Select one, then right click on it
and select "Isolate mesh". Once isolated click on the export button in the task bar at the top.
Make sure to select the file type as "Wavefront (.obj)" and select scope as "Visible Only", then
click export and voila!
